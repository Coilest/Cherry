# About

Cherry Blossom (often shortened to Cherry because I'm lazy) was originally a chlib fork I created sometime ago to add more functionality to the library for my use case. Now, it's no longer a fork, and has been rewritten many times, and is also open source, rather than being closed source for my bots usage only (Intellect).

# Documentation

Documentation is coming, I swear. For the moment, the docstrings in `example.py` should suffice.
